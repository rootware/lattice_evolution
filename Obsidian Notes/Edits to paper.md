Things to do:

1. Jittery lattice:
	- [x] run jitter data again for DSP sequence, but average over multiple values for each $\sigma$
	- [x] run jitter data similarly for SP sequence
	- [x] Plot JSD variation for both on same plot
This has changed now:
	- This can now be done using a plot of JSD(a,a=0) for different sigma
	- And show the short distance expansion
	- 
1. Write Robustness paragraph:
	1. Shot to shot variation
	2. Mistaken belief in lattice depth
	3. "jittering lattice" 
2. Ask John about Allan deviation
3. Bayesian $P(a,V|M)$ plot:
	- [ ] Fix last panel to also have fewer tick labels
4. Combined JSD plots:
	- [ ] Move curvature plot into place of cross correlation
	- [ ] Discuss curvature plot
	- [ ] add blue marker to origin
	- [ ] Add discussion:
		- [ ] Discuss how there is a tilt in curvature, and this leads to slight correlation
		- [ ] Add in appendix a discussion of SP sequence for comparison?
	- [ ] CFI plot:
		- [ ] Add CFI plot to replace pixelation noise
		- [ ]
