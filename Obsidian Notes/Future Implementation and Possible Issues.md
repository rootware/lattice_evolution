## Possible Bugs:
A list of cases to double check:
- The current code manually hard-codes which eigenvector is chosen, since `nalgebra` doesn't sort the eigenvectors by eigenvalues by default.  Double-check that this hard-coded value is valid for Hamiltonian diagonalization for $V \in [9.0, 11.0]$

## Future Implementation Goals:
1. **Evolving state derivatives w.r.t parameters**:
	- Use the Augmented State method to calculate derivatives.
2. **Checking CFI and QFI**
	- Check CFI and QFI values as generated by augmented state method
3. **C++/Python interop**
	- Python interop can be done using PyO3
	- C++ interop would be more difficult
