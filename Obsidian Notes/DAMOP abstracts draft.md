## De-correlated Multiparameter End to End Design for Quantum Sensors

Quantum sensing platforms have emerged as a near-term application of quantum devices for precision measurements of physical quantities. Various protocols for designing quantum sensors exist for sensing both a single or multiple quantities of interest. A current challenge, however, is engineering a quantum sensor to have maximum sensitivity to the parameters we wish to measure while being highly robust to noise in design parameters. We present a novel way of achieving both goals in a quantum sensor and de-correlating the sensitivities for different parameters. Our approach relies on recent advances in  multiparameter classical and quantum fisher information matrices. We further demonstrate  how our approach can be implemented in an end-to-end fashion, where the sensor's design is globally optimized rather than component by component optimization.

As an example of a use case, we design a robust  shaken lattice atom interferometer  that is maximally sensitive to applied accelerations and insensitive to noise in lattice parameters.  For the variational optimization, we use reinforcement learning (RL) methods and show a multi-arm interferometer design that exceeds the maximal sensitivity obtained  by -Mach Zehnder design for lattice atom interferometers.
