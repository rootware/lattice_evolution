# Shaken Lattice Statistical Analysis (Rust version)
This project began as a learning experience: to code the C++ version of the SLI in Rust. However, this has since become the main code for generating momentum probabilities as
- Implemented multithreading, so faster runs
- Was able to do more precise runs, and hence do faster comparisons between JSD plots.
