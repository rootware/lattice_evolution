### Bayesian:

On single parameter:
- For some reason, regenerated plots are coming out with a different from CR bound. Double check why
- Use rust code if need be
On SPvMP,
- See if i can use the previous measurement files for making the plot
- That way, we have consistency
- Estimate dynamic range

### Paper Edits: 
- Fig 1 : show general sensing?
- Font size on plots? Esp in Fig.9, 
- Ask people about fig font size
- Check in with John about scheduling for Thursday/Friday for meeting?
- Fix bayesian plots to bein $g$..
- add lattice JSD plots
- Add plot showing $\phi_a = a k_L T^2$ wrap around, which should happen when $\phi_a = 2\pi n$, which yields $a=0.08221969228087173 \omega_r v_r$. In 1064nm laser, this turns out to be $a=0.46080207078695073g$ .
